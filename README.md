# eBay-like E2E Automation Framework

End-to-end test automation for [ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io) using Python, Playwright, and Allure.

## Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Playwright 1.45 (Chromium)
- pytest 8.2 with parametrize
- Allure Reports + Playwright Trace

## Quick start

```bash
make install   # install Python packages + Chromium (once)
make test      # run the tests — a browser window opens so you can watch
make report    # open the Allure HTML report
```

That's it. All commands are in the `Makefile`.

---

## Before running — set your credentials

Open `test_data.json` and replace the credentials with a registered account on `ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io`:

```json
"credentials": {
  "username": "your_email@example.com",
  "password": "YourPassword"
}
```

Register a free account at:
`https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/index.php?route=account/register`

## All available commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make install` | Install dependencies + Chromium browser |
| `make test` | Run all E2E tests (browser visible) |
| `make test-headless` | Run without a browser window (for CI) |
| `make report` | Open Allure HTML report |
| `make clean` | Delete screenshots, reports, cache |

The report includes:
- Feature / Story tags
- Per-step screenshots attached inline
- Text log of every item added to cart
- Environment panel (URL, browser, Python version)
- Playwright Trace attachment

## View Playwright Trace

After a run, open the trace in the browser-based viewer:

1. Go to [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev)
2. Drop `artifacts/trace.zip` onto the page

The trace shows every action, network request, and DOM snapshot for the full session.
